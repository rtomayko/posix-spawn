  module Spawn
    # POSIX::Spawn::Child includes logic for executing child processes and
    # reading/writing from their standard input, output, and error streams. It's
    # designed to take all input in a single string and provides all output
    # (stderr and stdout) as single strings and is therefore not well-suited
    # to streaming large quantities of data in and out of commands.
    #
    # Create and run a process to completion:
    #
    #   >> child = POSIX::Spawn::Child.new('git', '--help')
    #
    # Retrieve stdout or stderr output:
    #
    #   >> child.out
    #   => "usage: git [--version] [--exec-path[=GIT_EXEC_PATH]]\n ..."
    #   >> child.err
    #   => ""
    #
    # Check process exit status information:
    #
    #   >> child.status
    #   => #<Process::Status: pid=80718,exited(0)>
    #
    # To write data on the new process's stdin immediately after spawning:
    #
    #   >> child = POSIX::Spawn::Child.new('bc', :input => '40 + 2')
    #   >> child.out
    #   "42\n"
    #
    # To access output from the process even if an exception was raised:
    #
    #   >> child = POSIX::Spawn::Child.build('git', 'log', :max => 1000)
    #   >> begin
    #   ?>   child.exec!
    #   ?> rescue POSIX::Spawn::MaximumOutputExceeded
    #   ?>   # just so you know
    #   ?> end
    #   >> child.out
    #   "... first 1000 characters of log output ..."
    #
    # Q: Why use POSIX::Spawn::Child instead of popen3, hand rolled fork/exec
    # code, or Process::spawn?
    #
    # - It's more efficient than popen3 and provides meaningful process
    #   hierarchies because it performs a single fork/exec. (popen3 double forks
    #   to avoid needing to collect the exit status and also calls
    #   Process::detach which creates a Ruby Thread!!!!).
    #
    # - It handles all max pipe buffer (PIPE_BUF) hang cases when reading and
    #   writing semi-large amounts of data. This is non-trivial to implement
    #   correctly and must be accounted for with popen3, spawn, or hand rolled
    #   fork/exec code.
    #
    # - It's more portable than hand rolled pipe, fork, exec code because
    #   fork(2) and exec aren't available on all platforms. In those cases,
    #   POSIX::Spawn::Child falls back to using whatever janky substitutes
    #   the platform provides.
